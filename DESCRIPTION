Package: TFBSfindR
Type: Package
Title: Variant analysis on Transcription factor binding site
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Douwe Spaanderman
Maintainer: The package maintainer <dspaanderman@gmail.com>
Description: TFBSfindR analysis sequences in vcf or fasta files
    identifying TFBS based on their motifs. Afterwards, variant
    and reference scores for TF binding are compared to investigate
    variants that change these TFBS, either by desrupting a motif or
    by creating one.
